            Impact of EVs in the FinTech industry

          <h3 className=" text-blue-800 font-bold py-5">
            Let’s offend: Boomer- EVs are too expensive! Reality- Your “savings”
            on buying a combustion engine vehicle get’s easily exhausted buying
            fuel for its lifetime.
          </h3>
          <h3 className=" text-blue-800 font-bold py-5">
            Fuel isn’t cheap like it was “back in your day”!

          <p>
            Fintechs play a critical role in the EV industry, particularly in
            the small commercial two and three-wheeler segments. Fintechs
            provide convenience, speed, and reach. The deeper involvement of the
            fintech sector with that of the EV might enable the industry to grow
            at a rate of 10-20 times its current rate.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Data-driven tools are used by digital lending platforms to make
            underwriting judgments. Quick and precise decisions about the
            borrower's purpose and capacity can be made using non-traditional
            data such as psychometrics, SMS, and biometrics, which are overlaid
            with machine learning algorithms.
          </p>
          <h3 className=" text-blue-800 font-bold">Why is Fintech required?</h3>
          <p>
            The use of digital platforms also eliminates the need for a lot of
            human intervention, making it possible to give loans even in tiny
            communities with low sales. This aids in obtaining a cost advantage.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            In this market, digital payments have a relatively low penetration
            rate. In most cases, first and final mile delivery is handled by an
            electric commercial two or three-wheeler driver. They can get their
            fare/payment in e-wallets, hand back any change to their customers
            through the wallet, and, most importantly, repay their loan
            instalments digitally with digital payments. All of this will make
            them a member of the 'formal' economy and provide them with a wealth
            of data, opening them up to a slew of new prospects in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            By minimizing expenses and human intervention, the use of digital
            technologies in insurance claims settlement to estimate damage
            through video and pattern recognition will also make insurance
            models sustainable.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Embedded IoT devices assist lenders and insurers in tracking
            automobiles, limiting the range of vehicle movement through
            geofencing, immobilizing vehicles, and determining driver
            productivity. Higher productivity translates to more money and
            better debt management.

            Supporting the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-5">
            Fintechs have a vital role in the development of the electric
            vehicle ecosystem. Partnerships with insurance providers to provide
            borrowers with the vehicle, life, and EMI protection insurance;
            partnerships with battery manufacturers to finance replacement
            batteries; partnerships with battery charging and swapping providers
            to create an instalment-cum-subscription model to reduce the initial
            capital required to buy vehicles; and partnerships with aggregators
            to provide revenue/earning opportunities to drivers making loan
            instalment payments easily are just a few examples.

            Electric vehicles will be around for a long time. The notion of
            electric vehicles was born out of environmental concerns, and
            India's national and state governments have made various legislative
            measures to encourage EV adoption. Electric two and three-wheelers
            have excellent economics, with the cheap purchase and operating
            costs. The demand for work in small towns is expected to rise as a
            result of the recent reverse migration caused by COVID-19. The
            demand for EVs is on a strong growth trajectory due to a combination
            of the foregoing, as well as an increase in e-commerce, hyperlocal
            deliveries, and first/last mile connection.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Fintechs' digital technology, when paired with technology from other
            ecosystem players like insurers, e-commerce, payments, and
            aggregators, would result in a solid and scalable electric car model
            in India.
          </p>
          <h3 className=" text-blue-800 font-bold">
            What does the future hold for EVs?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The electric car industry's current state is still improving. The
            global stock of electric automobiles is expected to expand at a
            compound annual growth rate of 33%, from 3.1 million units in 2017
            to 125 million by 2030, according to estimates. According to the
            International Energy Agency, by 2040, electric vehicles will account
            for 55 per cent of all sales of new cars and 33 per cent of the
            worldwide fleet.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            This simply means that demand for manufacturing and production will
            continue to climb, and electric vehicle companies will want all of
            the financial assistance they can obtain. FinTech solutions,
            thankfully, can give the resources they need to keep going forward
            and attain their full potential for general acceptance.

            Tax deductions on loans for EVs
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-5">
            Section 80EEB allows for a total tax exemption of up to Rs 1,50,000
            when paying off an EV loan. This tax credit is valid for both
            four-wheeled and two-wheeled electric vehicles.
          </p>
          <h3 className=" text-blue-800 font-bold">Criteria for Eligibility</h3>
          <p className="pb-5">
            Individuals are the only ones who can benefit from this tax
            deduction. This deduction is not available to any other taxpayer. As
            a result, if you are a HUF, AOP, Partnership firm, company, or any
            other type of taxpayer, you cannot claim any benefit under this
            provision.
          </p>
          <h3>The conditions that apply to Section 80EEB are listed below.</h3>
          <p>
            Each person is only eligible for this exemption once. This means
            that Section 80EEB loan tax reduction is only available to people
            who have never owned an electric vehicle previously.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Only those who are financing an electric vehicle are eligible for
            this exemption. A loan from a financial organization or a
            non-banking financial company should be used to fund the EV (NBFC).
          </p>
          <p>
            The clause allows for tax savings on EV loan repayments made between
            April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2023.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Tax incentives under Section 80EEB will be available beginning in FY
            2020-2021.

            Is it true that electric vehicles are better for the environment?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most significant advantage of electric automobiles is the
            contribution they can make to improving air quality in cities. Pure
            electric automobiles produce no carbon dioxide emissions when
            driving because they do not have a tailpipe. This significantly
            minimizes air pollution.
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Simply put, electric automobiles provide cleaner streets, making our
            cities and towns safer for walkers and bikers. Just one electric car
            on the road for a year can save an average of 1.5 million grams of
            CO2.{" "}

          <p className="pb-5">
            In this comparison, an electric vehicle is compared to a gasoline
            vehicle. The major goal is to help users understand why, how, and in
            which situations electro-mobility lives up to its green image by
            reducing per-km emissions when compared to its fossil-fuel-based
            alternative. A second goal is to demonstrate how electric vehicles
            can "counter-perform" in various situations, such as when the
            battery size varies, the background electricity mix changes, the
            battery lifetime changes, or how winter circumstances affect battery
            performance.

            If you think you're late to the party because there's so much noise
            about electric vehicle stocks, you're not. In India, electric
            vehicles account for only 1% of total vehicle sales, although most
            research organizations project the industry to increase rapidly by
            2030. To put it another way, the electric vehicle revolution is only
            getting begun.

          <p className="py-5">
            What will the future of the electric vehicle revolution look like?
            Will electric vehicles be able to entirely replace conventional
            vehicles? What types of businesses would profit from them? Our
            course on EVs on Quest will teach you everything you need to know
            about the sector.
